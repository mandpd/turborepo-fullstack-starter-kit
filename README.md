# Turborepo Fullstack Starter Kit

This is a starter kit to enable nextjs frondend apps that use a nestjs backend server. 

## Using this template

1. Configure a `.env.local` file in the `apps\web` folder with a key/value pair of
   API_URL=http://localhost:5005
   where 5005 is the default port on which the nestjs server is running

2. Start the front end with `pnpm dev` from the root,

3. Start the backend by cd to 'apps/backend' and then `pnpm start`



```sh

```

## What's inside?

The repo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `backend`: a [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
- `@repo/types` a library of types shared by both `web` and `backend` applications


Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, 

1. run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm dev
```

Then start the nestjas server in a separate terminal instance using

```
pnpm start
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
